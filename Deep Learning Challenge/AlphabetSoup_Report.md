**<h1>Alphabet Soup Report</h1>**
*<h3>Module 21 Challenge - Deep Learning Challenge</h3>*





**1.	Overview of the analysis:** *Explain the purpose of this analysis.*

The purpose of this analysis is to attempt to create a tool that would predict applicants with the highest chance of success for the nonprofit organization, Alphabet Soup.

**2.	Results:** *Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:*

-   **Data Preprocessing**
	- *What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?*
	- *What variable(s) are the features for your model?*
	- *What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?*

- **Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model**
	- *How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?*
	- *Were you able to achieve the target model performance?*
	- *What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?*


**3.	Summary:** *Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.*
