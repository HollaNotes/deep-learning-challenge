*<h3>Module 21 Challenge - Deep Learning Challenge</h3>*





**1.	Overview of the analysis:** *Explain the purpose of this analysis.*

- The purpose of this analysis is to attempt to create a tool that would predict applicants with the highest chance of success for the nonprofit organization, Alphabet Soup.

**2.	Results:** *Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:*

-   **Data Preprocessing**
	- *What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?*
    	- "IS_SUCCESSFUL"
	- *What variable(s) are the features for your model?*
    	- "APPLICATION_TYPE"
        - "AFFILIATION"
        - "CLASSIFICATION"
        - "USE_CASE"
        - "ORGANIZATION"
        - "STATUS"
        - "INCOME_AMT"
        - "SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS"
        - "ASK_AMT"
	- *What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?*
    	- "EIN"
    	- "NAME"

- **Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model**
	- *How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?*
    	- I initially set my model to 2 hidden layers. I set the first layer to 86 neurons with the relu activation function. I set the second layer to 43 neurons with the relu function. I decided to start with 86 neurons because one of the notes in the 21.2 class Readme said, "In general, when building the initial model, we should use 2â€“3 times as many neurons as there are input features." so I figured doubling the input dimension would be a good place to start. This lead to a model performance of *72.59%* accuracy.
	- *Were you able to achieve the target model performance?* 
    	- No, I was unable to achieve the target model performance of 75%.
	- *What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?*
    	- **Optimization Attempt 1** - In my first optimization attempt, I tried to increase model performance by adding an additional hidden layer. This lead to a model performance of *72.48%* accuracy.
    	- **Optimization Attempt 2** - In my second optimization attempt, I tried to increase model performance by decreasing neurons to my first 2 layers. This lead to a model performance of *72.79%* accuracy. 
    	- **Optimization Attempt 3** - In my second optimization attempt, I tried to increase model performance by increasing the number or epochs. This lead to a model performance of *72.52%* accuracy.
    	- **Optimization with hp.Choice** - I decided to try and find the best optimization parameters for this model by using auto optimization. After getting low results, I wanted to see if there was another way to optimize my model that would yield wildly different results. Unfortunately, this only lead to a model performance of *72.89%* accuracy.


**3.	Summary:** *Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.*
- Overall, the results of the deep learning model were not strong enough to be able to use as a tool to predict applicants with the highest chance of success. Although I was able to play around with the model to see if I could improve upon the accuracy, I was unable to get my model to perform at 75% accuracy. Even when performing an auto-optimization, the highest accuracy I was able to achieve was less than 75%. Using a random forest model could be a better way to solve this classification problem by letting you see which features are important and which ones we could leave off in order to improve performance.
